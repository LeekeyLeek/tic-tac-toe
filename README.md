I've primarily used this project to practice Object Oriented programming even more with factory functions and following the module pattern.

To start a new game, you first have to click the "Name Change" button to set a name for player one and player two. Once the names are set, it's just a game of regular tic-tac-toe. The winner will be displayed at the top of the board. 

Hit the "Reset" button to start a new round. This will keep your current names unless you choose to change them.
